## How to use the Plugin

### Environment Variables

Copy .env.example to .env. and set the following variables:
   * REACT_APP_SERVICE_BASE_URL: your Twilio Functions base url (this will be available after you deploy your functions). This should be just the base url (Example: https://some-words-1234.twil.io make sure to not include anything after the .io) 
   * REACT_APP_DEFAULT_TWILIO_NUMBER: The default Twilio Number to be used for sending sms messages, in E.164 format. 

  **Note**: Remember that both .env.development and .env.production is for front-end use so do not add any type of key/secret variable to them. When developing, the .env.development is used while the .env.production is used when building and deploying the plugin. Also, just variables starting with the name *REACT_APP_* will work.

### Installing dependencies 
Open terminal and navigate to the plugin directory, install the dependencies by running 

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Development and Test

In order to develop locally, you can use the Webpack Dev Server by running:

```bash
$ twilio flex:plugins:start
```

This will automatically start up the Webpack Dev Server and open the browser for you. Your app will run on `http://localhost:3000`. If you want to change that you can do this by setting the `PORT` environment variable:

### Deploy

When you are ready to deploy your plugin, in your terminal run:

```bash
$ twilio flex:plugins:deploy --major --changelog "Initial plugin deployment" --description "ByBlue Flex POC"
```

This will deploy your plugin to your Twilio Flex Project. See [Deploy and release using the Flex Plugins CLI](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/developer/plugins/cli/deploy-and-release#deploying-a-major-version-of-a-plugin) for more information

### Release
Last step is to release the plugin.  The above command will provide the text to copy and paste for releasing the plugin. The text will look like:

```bash
$ twilio flex:plugins:release --plugin plugin-outbound-sms@1.0.0 --name "Autogenerated Release " --description "The description of this Flex Plugin Configuration"
```

## Plugin Structure

The `src\` folder contains all the files that make up this plugin. 

- `src\FlexOutboundSms.js` - This is the main plugin file and loads SmsView.js into Panel3
- `components\SubheadingComponent.js` - React component for building the header of the various views
- `components\SmsView.js` - SMS view use to enter a message and deliver it for SMS.  This component calls the `send-sms.js` and `flex-sms-task.js` function.
- `src\functions\` - contains the .js function code for Twilio Functions  **Note:** These functions were originally deployed with Functions V1 by copying over to Twilio Functions. For production it is recommended to use Twilio Serverless.

For more details on deploying your plugin, refer to the [deploying your plugin guide](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/plugins#deploying-your-plugin).

Note: Common packages like `React`, `ReactDOM`, `Redux` and `ReactRedux` are not bundled with the build because they are treated as external dependencies so the plugin will depend on Flex to provide them globally.
